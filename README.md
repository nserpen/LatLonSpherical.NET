# LatLonSpherical.NET
Partial implementation of https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy

# Intro
Project is started from a requirement of true calculation of distance between two geo coordinates, in degrees. Starting from distance calculations, it will evolve.
# Platform Support
.Net Framework 4.5.2 (soon .Net Standard 1.2)
# Thanks
During the research, a valuable resource I met, [Calculate distance, bearing and more between Latitude/Longitude points](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html) was the starting point. The original javascript library can be found in github perository [geodesy](https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy). Many thanks to [Chris Veness](https://github.com/chrisveness).
